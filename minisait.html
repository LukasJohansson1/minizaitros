        <p>
          Koi or more specifically nishikigoi "brocaded carp"), are colored
          varieties of the Amur carp (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) that are kept for
          decorative purposes in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens. Koi is an
          informal name for the colored variants of C. There are many varieties
          of ornamental koi, originating from breeding that began in Niigata,
          Japan in the early 19th century. Several varieties are recognized by
          the Japanese, distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation.
          Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue,
          brown and cream, besides metallic shades like gold and silver-white
          ('platinum') scales.

          <p>
            Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes from the subfamily
            Amphiprioninae in the family Pomacentridae. Thirty species of
            clownfish are recognized: one in the genus Premnas, while the
            remaining are in the genus Amphiprion. In the wild, they all form
            symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones. Depending on the species,
            anemonefish are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish
            color, and many show white bars or patches. The largest can reach a
            length of 17 cm, while the smallest barely achieve 7-8 cm.

            Synchiropus splendidus, the mandarinfish or mandarin dragonet, is a
            small, brightly colored member of the dragonet family, which is
            popular in the saltwater aquarium trade. The mandarinfish is native
            to the Pacific, ranging approximately from the Ryukyu Islands south
            to Australia. It can usually be found in some of the warmer waters.
