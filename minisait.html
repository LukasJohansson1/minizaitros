          <p>
            Koi or more specifically nishikigoi "brocaded carp"), are colored
            varieties of the Amur carp (Cyprinus rubrofuscus) that are kept for
            decorative purposes in outdoor koi ponds or water gardens. Koi is an
            informal name for the colored variants of C. There are many
            varieties of ornamental koi, originating from breeding that began in
            Niigata, Japan in the early 19th century. Several varieties are
            recognized by the Japanese, distinguished by coloration, patterning,
            and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red,
            orange, yellow, blue, brown and cream, besides metallic shades like
            gold and silver-white ('platinum') scales.

          <p>
            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a
            member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark
            vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex
            predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild
            boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social
            predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its
            requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay
            with their mother for about two years and then become independent,
            leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.

          <p>
            The wolf also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine
            native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of
            Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly
            understood, comprise wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant
            member of the family Canidae. It is also distinguished from other
            Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a
            shorter torso and a longer tail. The banded fur of a wolf is usually
            mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the
            arctic region may be nearly all white.
